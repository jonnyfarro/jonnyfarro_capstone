<h1>Fueling Longevity : Proteins Role in Life Expectency </h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

This project analyzes food consumption patterns and their correlation with life expectancy across various countries and years. By examining dietary trends and longevity, the study aims to identify key food categories that may significantly influence population health and lifespan. The analysis will utilize datasets encompassing food consumption data per capita and life expectancy figures, employing data visualization techniques to reveal potential links between dietary habits and longevity. The findings could provide valuable insights for promoting healthier eating habits and improving public health 


<h2>Motivation</h2>
The motivation behind this project stems from a growing interest in understanding the impact of dietary choices on overall health and lifespan. With rising global concerns about chronic diseases and increasing healthcare costs, exploring the relationship between food consumption and life expectancy becomes crucial. By investigating how different food categories contribute to longevity, this research seeks to empower individuals, communities, and policymakers with data-driven insights to promote healthier eating habits and enhance public well-being.

<h2>Data Questions</h2>

- What is the correlation between the consumption of protein and life expectancy across different regions, and how has this relationship changed over time?


-What is the correlation between the consumption of protein and life expectancy across different regions, and how has this relationship changed over time?


-How does life expectancy vary between countries with higher vegetable protein intake versus those with higher animal protein intake, and do these patterns vary by region?

<h2>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h2>
I intend to explore specific food categories or regional trends in greater detail with python, and  incorporate an interactive element with tableau into the final presentation. The final capstone project will be suitable for a broader audience interested in the impact of dietary choices on health and longevity.

<h2>Known Issues and Challenges</h2>


Life expectancy is influenced by various factors beyond diet, such as healthcare access, socioeconomic conditions, and lifestyle choices. I'll need to consider these factors during the analysis and interpretation of results.
 
Establishing a direct causal link between specific food consumption and life expectancy is complex. I'll focus on identifying correlations and potential associations rather than making definitive causal claims.
